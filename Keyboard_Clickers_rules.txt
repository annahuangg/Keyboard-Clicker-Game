1. The Keyboard Clicker is based off of Cookie Clicker, a game where the user continuously presses a cookie to earn more keys and upgrades.
   Once the game starts, you will be prompted to click the space bar. The more you press the spacebar, the more keys you will earn.
   
2. Once you have enough keys to purchase an upgrade, you will have the option to upgrade the multiplier for how many keys you get per click.

3. If at any point you wish to save your progress, you will have the option to save your progress as an access code.
